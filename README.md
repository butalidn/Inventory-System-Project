# **Inventory System Project: Software I**

For this course, a JavaFX application with a GUI was created. The project was written in Java and the graphical interface was developed using Scene Builder to create the needed FXML files. 

The goal of the project was to create an inventory system that allowed the user to manually add, remove, and modify various parts and products.
The program also handles expections by displaying error messages for scenarios specified by the project guidelines. The user is also able to filter parts or products by
using the provided search bars.

The project focused on understanding inheritance, abstract and concrete classes, instance and static variables, and instance and static methods.
